# Contributing to EuConform

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`pnpm test`).
5. Make sure your code lints (`pnpm lint`).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT and EUPL-1.2 Licenses

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Hiepler/EuConform/issues)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to has:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
